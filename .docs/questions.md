### Jetpack Movement
- Movement is controlled by mouse (where the mouse points, the player moves) or WASD
- Along which axes can the player move (X,Y,Z)?
- Does the player always move forward, or only when something is activated (like pressing W or a HUD button)?

### Obtaining the Jetpack
- How does the player obtain the jetpack (e.g., prompt activation, etc.), and in what form (as a tool or some)?

### Camera

- If scripted, what requirements should the camera behavior have (following the player, zoom, rotation)?
- Should the camera support different modes (race, menu, cutscenes)?
