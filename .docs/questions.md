Hello everyone, I'm sorry for being late, I need some time to organize the schedule properly. Today I did several things, created a Git repository that will show the project progress, you can already check it out at the link
https://github.com/GlitchiPitch/jetpack-race

please pay attention to the commits, will this format of commit messages be convenient and informative for you. [ current status ] [ game version ] [ commit author ] Then description of changes. If yes, then we keep this option or would you like to improve it? add or remove something

the repository will store all the materials I have made

also for convenience, I will send a separate document in the format you need (.pdf, .docs, etc.) about important changes

for further work, I need to resolve a number of questions, and you can help me with this. I read the GDD and
I have a number of questions

### Obtaining the Jetpack
- How does the player obtain the jetpack (prompt activation or purchase etc.), and in what form (as a tool or some)?

### Camera
- Is a classic camera needed, or a scripted camera?
- If scripted, what requirements should the camera behavior have (following the player, zoom, rotation)?
- Should the camera support different modes (race, menu, cutscenes)?

### Developer Products
- What types of items are available for purchase during flight?
  - Speed boosts
  - Rebirths
  - (others)


I took into account in the development support for future mechanics (speed scaling based on skills)

currently, the main project structure has been created (implemented leaderboard systems, flight, pets, rewards, rebirths) and mechanics are partially implemented, I continue to work on them

I remember that you wrote about Trello, if you give me access, I will mark the progress there


Also, I only very recently started practicing English again and didn't think it would be needed so soon, but I'm not quite ready for live communication yet, I need time to practice English. 

Tomorrow I plan to spend time setting up interfaces and flight mechanics.
